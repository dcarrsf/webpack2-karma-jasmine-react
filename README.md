## How to get started

The project uses Webpack to bundle and transpile the source code to a browser friendly format. You can run the project in two modes (dev and build).

### Dev mode

Dev mode launches the project in the Webpack Dev Server with hot reloading for editing convience. Run the following command and open a browser to http://localhost:8080.

```
$ npm run dev
```

### Build mode

Build mode sets the environment to 'production' and optimizes the bundle for deployment. The files are optimized using Webpack plugins, replacing React with Preact, and GZipping the resulting bundle. Run the following command and view the files in the build folder.

```
$ npm run build
```
